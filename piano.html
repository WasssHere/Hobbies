<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano">Piano - Wikipedia</a></h4><p>The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by hammers. It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.</p></blockquote>
